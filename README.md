# IdeaBox

*Tanisha Davey, Noah Gambee, Cody Smith*
IdeaBox is a web app that allows you to log different ideas onto a web page. You may 'star' or favorite a certain idea, and you may delete an idea if you choose to.

We used HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS on this project. 
Our biggest goal in this project was to utilize local storage in our Javascript. While it is not working perfectly, it has a good starting functionality and any bugs could be filtered out in future versions.
